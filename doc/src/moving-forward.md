PDF currently supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms. Both formats today coexist in the PDF specification:

    AcroForms (also known as Acrobat forms), introduced in the PDF 1.2 format specification and included in all later PDF specifications.
    Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) forms, introduced in the PDF 1.5 format specification. Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with AcroForms.[27] XFA was deprecated from PDF with PDF 2.0.
